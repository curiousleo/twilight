To do
=====

Numerical integration
---------------------

- Move numerical integration to its own header & source file
- Add Euler, other RK methods
- Variable-degree RK? (Partial functions? Lambdas.)
- Error-checking integration?

Solar Eclipse Detection
-----------------------

- Check if d(Sun, Moon) < d(Sun, Earth): Confusing solar and lunar
  eclipses right now
- Maybe add counter to skip check if the time difference to the last
  eclipse is too small
- If dt is large, maybe Euler to check if eclipse between t and t+dt?
- Do a rough constant angle based check if solar eclipse is possible at
  all before doing more complex geometry based stuff (own header &
  source file?)
- Then, check if there is a solar eclipse and what type it is by
  following the four tangents of both Sun and Moon
- (Add lunar eclipse detection as well)

General
-------

- Use range-based for loops, for_each, lambdas, enum classes
