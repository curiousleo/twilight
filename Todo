To do
=====

CMake
-----

- Add boost_program_options

Output
------

- Being able to pipe things is nice, but using cerr as cmd output is
  ugly: Find a better way of outputting two things, namely
  * Planet positions in "show_sim" format, and
  * Dates and types of eclipses in csv format,
  simultaneously.

Numerical integration
---------------------

- Variable-degree RK? (Partial functions? Lambdas.)
- Error-checking integration?

Eclipse Detection
-----------------

- Maybe add counter to skip check if the time difference to the last
  eclipse is too small
- If dt is large, maybe Euler to check if eclipse between t and t+dt?
- Do a rough constant angle based check if solar eclipse is possible at
  all before doing more complex geometry based stuff (own header &
  source file?)
- Then, check if there is a solar eclipse and what type it is by
  following the four tangents of both Sun and Moon

Done
----

- Move numerical integration to its own header & source file
- Add Euler, other RK methods
- Check if d(Sun, Moon) < d(Sun, Earth): Confusing solar and lunar
  eclipses right now
- (Add lunar eclipse detection as well)
- Command-line arguments for dt, integration method, â€¦
- Use range-based for loops, for_each, lambdas, enum classes
- Gaussian quadrature
