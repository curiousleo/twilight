To do
=====

Output
------

- Being able to pipe things is nice, but using cerr as cmd output is
  ugly: Find a better way of outputting two things, namely
  * Planet positions in "show_sim" format, and
  * Dates and types of eclipses in csv format,
  simultaneously.

Numerical integration
---------------------

- Variable-degree RK? (Partial functions? Lambdas.)
- Error-checking integration?

Eclipse Detection
-----------------

- Maybe add counter to skip check if the time difference to the last
  eclipse is too small
- If dt is large, maybe Euler to check if eclipse between t and t+dt?
- Do a rough constant angle based check if solar eclipse is possible at
  all before doing more complex geometry based stuff
